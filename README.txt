## Introduction

### Dataset Description 

**The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer 
does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has 12485 rows and 27 colums. 
The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov in an exile.  
The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearms checks by month, state, and type. 
The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have 
one data point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.** 
 
## Investigating a Dataset

Learn the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Learn how to work with data in
Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

- The project uses NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries.
- Where possible, vectorized operations and built-in functions are used instead of loops.

## Wrangle Phase

-The project documents the steps that were taken to clean the data, such as merging multiple files, handling missing values, etc.

# Exploration Phase

The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles.
The project explores at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest.
The project performs both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.

# Communication
- The code should have ideally the following sections: Introduction; Questions; Data Wrangling; Exploratory Data Analysis; Conclusions, Limitation.
- Reasoning is provided for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary.
- Interpretation of plots and application of statistical tests should be correct and without error.
- Comments are used within the code cells.
- Documented the flow of analysis in the mark-down cells.
- Visualizations made in the project depict the data in an appropriate manner 
(i.e., has appropriate labels, scale, legends, and plot type) that allows plots to be readily interpreted.
